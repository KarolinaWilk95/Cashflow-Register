# Receivables and Payables Register

The project was created with the aim of improving work efficiency at my previous position by developing a Receivables and Payables Register that is automatically updated. Its purpose is to assist individuals responsible for entering documents into the system and supervising their proper processing.

### The application includes several key features:

* Generating various reports to support analytical work and enable better data management.

* Grouping payment due dates for improved monitoring of payables and receivables.

Automating this process will save time and increase work efficiency while ensuring greater accuracy in data processing.
